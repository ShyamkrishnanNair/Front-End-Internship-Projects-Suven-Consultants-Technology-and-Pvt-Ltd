# Front-End-Internship-SCTPL

## About

Welcome to the Front-End Internship project repository! In this repository, you'll find two front-end projects developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These projects were a part of my Front End Internship that I did at Suven Consultants and Technology Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai.

## Projects

### 1. Responsive Admin Dashboard Page Using HTML & CSS

This project is a responsive admin dashboard page built with HTML and CSS. It features a clean and modern design, with responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. The dashboard includes various components such as navigation menus, charts, and data tables.

### 2. Responsive Admin Dashboard Page Using HTML & CSS

Similar to the first project, this is another responsive admin dashboard page built with HTML and CSS. It showcases another design approach with different features and layout configurations. Just like the first project, it's fully responsive and suitable for various screen sizes.

## Contributions

I spent time working on these projects, learning new concepts, and improving my front-end development skills. Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in building responsive web pages, implementing modern design principles, and enhancing user interfaces.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Contributions are always welcome!
